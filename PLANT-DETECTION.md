This is supposed idea I've been researching on. 

We put Deep Learning to use to detect plants in a particluar image captured by a CCTV or such, using the image we proceed as follows:
- Detect plants in the image using a pre-trained model to do so.
- Retreive quality index of the vegetation based on the depth of a particular colour (ex. Green).
- Run analytics after repeatedly analysing the same image over and over in natural state.
- Automated reporting of anaytics district wise or reporting demographic area could be customised.
